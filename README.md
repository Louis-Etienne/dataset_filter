# How to use
1. Depending on the dataset folder configuration, you might want to change the *list_path* variable and the *isolate_exr* fonction to suit your needs
2. You can also change the *reasons* variable for your own note taking task
3. Change to *open_image* function so that it opens the file you want (the default one, opens exr files with the TEV application)
4. You should be ready to go! Run the script using : "python filter.py"

# Where are the notes saved?
The notes are saved in the *notes.json* file in a readable json format with the file names as the key
